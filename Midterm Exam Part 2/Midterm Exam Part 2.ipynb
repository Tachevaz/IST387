    "There is an upstart in the ride-sharing market: The new start-up firm **rYdZ** (pronounced “rides”) is driver-owned and operated. In addition to providing safe rides at competitive prices, the mission of **rYdZ** is to provide a working wage to **rYdZ** drivers. But the leadership team at **rYdZ** believes there is a problem: the two giants in the industry, **Lyft** and **Uber**, are coordinating to set prices for rides that are artificially low. The team at **rYdZ** has produced a data set of more than 100 fares offered to drivers from **Lyft** and **Uber**. Your job is to analyze this data set and infer whether there is some sort of coordination between **Lyft** and **Uber** to set prices, as well as understand if either is pricing based on miles driven, or perhaps, based on geography.\n",

There is also a **fare for a different ride** offered to a driver through Uber (and the **distance of that trip**). There are at least 100 observations (rows) in your dataset, and possibly more. Each observation was done at roughly the same time for Uber and Lyft (the data for the ride in a row was collected at roughly the same time).\n",
