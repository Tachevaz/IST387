Define a variable:


```R
  x <- 280
```

Define the following vectors, which represent the **population** (in thousands) and **number of colleges** in each of the five counties in Central New York (CNY) â€“ **Cayuga**, **Cortland**, **Madison**, **Onondaga**, and **Oswego**, in this order:


```R
population <- c(80, 49, 73, 467, 122)
colleges <- c(2, 2, 3, 9, 2)
```

# Part 1: Calculating statistics using R  

A.	Show the number of observations in the **population** vector with the length() function: 


```R
length(population)
```

B.	Show the number of observations in the **colleges** vector with the length() function:


```R

```

C.	Calculate the average CNY population using the mean() function:


```R

```

D.	Calculate the average number of colleges in CNY using the mean() function:


```R

```
