This package enhances the capabilities of ggplot by adding the capability to **draw geographic outlines (polygons), shading, labeling, and other map markings**. In addition, we will merge datasets using the built-in **merge( )** function, which provides a similar capability to a **JOIN in SQL**. Many analytical strategies require joining data from different sources based on a **“key”** – a field that two datasets have in common. \n",
